Thnan's Mod - Battle Pets

This module adds additional data to tooltips for wild battle pets, items that teach you
pets, and caged pets. These tooltips can now tell you the level, breed and quality of pets
of that species that you already own, as well as if that species is available at a higher
level elsewhere. Breed data can also be displayed in the pet journal.

All options can be found in the options control panel for the module, available through the
interface menu, or by the slash command, /tmod.
