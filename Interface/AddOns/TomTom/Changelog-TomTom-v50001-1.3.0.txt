Tagging v50001-1.3.0


--------------------

James Whitehead II:
	- Add an option to reset options on waypoints
	If you change the minimap display or world display options, they will
	not take affect for any waypoints that are already set. This button
	under 'General Options' will re-set these options on all of the
	currently set waypoints.
	- Fix a bug with distance callbacks
	If the player is within the distance callback circle when the waypoint
	is first set, the last parameter of the callback should be nil. This
	enables the callbacks to ignore the initial trigger of the callback.
	
	Practically, this stops /wayb from being immediately cleared.
	- Updated zhTW locale thanks to BNSSNB
