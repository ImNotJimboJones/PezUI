Tagging as v1.5


--------------------

funkydude:
	- bump to v1.5
	- You can once again change the rotation speed of a border without reloading (broken from when we moved to the Blizz animation system) Fix disabling a rotation screwing with the texture size
	- Fix border customization and TexBrowser detection
	- mop compat
	- Remove AceTimer and the BetterBlizzOptions lib
	- BorderPresets: Fix a crash on MoP when using the Jewels preset
	- MoP fixes
	- some minor tweaks
	- Merge autozoom into the general module
	- Borders: Re-write to use the Blizz animation system instead of using timers. You will need to re-select your preset to fix animation speed. Also, changing animation speed manually requires a reload for now.
	- Ping: Looks far better with a 3 second delay into a 3 second fade.
	- Ping: woops, some stuff got cut out
	- Ping: re-write. Use a nice fadeout animation instead of using acetimer and a blanket hide, recycle the frame we've already made instead of using aceevent.
	- Coordinates: Use an animation instead of AceTimer
	- Remove AceLocale and use our addon scope table instead
	- ZoneText: minor GUI display tweak
	- fix pkgmeta to point to the latest CBH
