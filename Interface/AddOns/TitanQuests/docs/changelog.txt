* fixed crashes with German WoW clients
* fixed garbled questlist when sorting by title

- removed quest description and summary from quest detail view (this reduces the size of the single quest view --- open the questlog, if you need to read the detailed information)
- removed quest details setting switches (all details are displayed, if applicaple)
- removed toggle options menu - the menu provided entries to toggle the quest log as well as for several third party addons (like QuestIOn, QuestHistory, etc.) - considering the efford required to always keep the toggling integration up-to-date with all these third party addons and with the added feature to toggle the questlog with a simple left-click on the Titan Quest icon, the decision had been made to remove this feature
- removed quest event display (since that's considered a feature outside the scope of Titan Quests)
- removed persistant quest tracking support - since that functionality was added to WoW 3.3.0, and hence became redundant
- removed option to use colored-text only (all text would be green)
- removed TitanQuests.xml (since it's no longer required - creation of frame objects has been moved to wowintegration.lua)

* tightened some default checking when getting quest info (it is possible that a quest does not return a valid 'quality' (green | blue | ...) so the default is 'gray' when this happens -- not sure if this is a feature or a bug)
