Tagging as  2.0.3


--------------------

Archarodim:
	- - TOC to 50100 - Removed options from Blizzard UI panel due to the massive taint issue happening since WoW 5.0. - Preparations for 2.0.3 release
	- Fixed the Lua error mentioned in the previous commit (it happen if LibNamePlate mistakes a foe for a friend)
	- Added some asserts to pinpoint a very rare and "impossible" infamous "attempt to index field "?" (a nil value)" Lua exception....
	- Removed commented lib in embeds.xml that would break parsing when using no-lib-strip
