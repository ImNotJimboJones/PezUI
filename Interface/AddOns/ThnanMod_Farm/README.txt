Thnan's Mod - Farm

This module adds a tool panel for your farm. The panel has buttons for every seed and every tool as well as a "grow check" button.
The seed buttons provide one-click planting in the nearest Tilled Soil.
Holding the shift key will cause seed buttons to show the bag for their crop. There is an option to reverse this behavior.
Right clicking a tool button will drop that tool. This can be turned off in the options menu.
Right clicking a seed button will enable planting the seed by double right clicking on a Tilled Soil.
The grow check button will target any plant that needs attention before it will grow, i.e. any plant that is not a "growing" plant.
Jogu's forecast will be saved and displayed in the tool panel. This feature does not work in some locales.
The tool panel also has buttons for your portal shards.

THIS MOD HAS BEEN SPLIT INTO SEPARATE PROJECTS FOR EACH MODULE. Future updates will only be available through the other projects. See the website for more information.
