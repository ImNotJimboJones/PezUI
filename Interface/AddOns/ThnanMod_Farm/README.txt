Thnan's Mod - Farm

This module adds a tool panel for your farm. The panel has buttons for every seed and every tool as well as a "grow check" button.
The seed buttons provide one-click planting in the nearest Tilled Soil.
Right clicking a tool button will drop that tool. This can be turned off in the options menu.
The grow check button will target any plant that needs attention before it will grow, i.e. any plant that is not a "growing" plant.
Jogu's forecast will be saved and displayed in the tool panel. Unfortunately, this feature currently only works with English locales.
The tool panel also has buttons for your portal shards.
