MrDressup 1.0.6
by Animal
----------------------
MrDressup is an addon I wrote for a very specific use for myself. All it does is add checkboxes directly to the character frame for easy access to change the display of your cloak and helm.

Although there are many great addons that allow you to automate the display of cloak and helm based on specific gear sets, I still wanted to be able to quickly alter the options without having to open the Blizzard options.

Use "/mrdressup show" or "/mrdressup hide" chat commands to show or hide the checkboxes.
Use "/mrdressup left" or "/mrdressup right" chat commands to move the checkboxes to the left or right side of the character frame.

This addon should work for all locales.
