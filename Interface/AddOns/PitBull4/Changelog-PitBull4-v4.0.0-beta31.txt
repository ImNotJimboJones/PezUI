Tagging as v4.0.0-beta31


--------------------

Shefki:
	- Build the full sorting table for the group otherwise filtered frames won't work. (e.g. filtered by raid group)
	I had an hackish way of doing it in there before that was a little
	faster but it can't work now that I fixed the sorting.
	- Remove debug code that whines about things being wrong when they aren't since I've made the code much smarter than this auto-detection can deal with.
	- Sorting with a partial raid in config mode is now consistent with how you'd expect it to behave.
	Unfilled slots are always considered to be towards the end of the sort
	(higher index, higher group number, a class that is last on the sort
	order, and a name that's alphabetically last).
	- Fix duplicates frames for real players in config mode when in a partially filled raid with sorting by group descending.
	- Fix an error with group sorted raid frames.
	- Rename GroupHeader:AssignFakeUnitIDs to GroupHeader:ApplyConfigModeState.
	No functional change just make the code make more sense now that
	function does a lot more than just set unit ids.
	- Fix Bug #864 - Group Config Mode Doesn't Work.
	Major refactoring of the way config mode works.  It should be faster,
	though it will still take some time if you go straight into raid40 mode
	without any of the frames existing.  However, subsequent changes in
	config mode states after that should be pretty quick.  One side
	effect of this is that the farmes won't immediately have the fake
	units assigned but will pick them up very shortly after.
	
	(Note to self: This commit differs from the anchor branch commit by the
	removal of changes to the new/remove config options for units and by the
	removal of logic in SwapGroupTemplate to check that the group is a pet
	group)
	Conflicts:
		GroupHeader.lua
		Options/Units.lua
	- Fix previous patch to put variables inside the function and make _ be local.
	- Remove an unused parameter on get_group_roster_info().
	- Check frame.unit is set before using it in PvPIcon module.
	- Switch to using the proper constants for a couple hardcoded values.
	(Note to self: Difference here between anchors branch and master in
	RefixSizeAndPosition)
	Conflicts:
		GroupHeader.lua
	- Change the GetNumTalentTabs fix to the style I prefer. This style doesn't litter the special code all over the file.
	- Put line endings back to Unix line endings on Filter.lua
	- Fix bug #982 preventing Other filter from catching uncategorized auras.
