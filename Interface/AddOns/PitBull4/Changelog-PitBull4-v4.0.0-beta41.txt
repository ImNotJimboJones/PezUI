Tagging as v4.0.0-beta41


--------------------

Shefki:
	- Add Tooth and Claw to Druid Self Buff Aura Filter in 5.1.x
	- Put LibDualSpec back to latest tag rather than alpha/beta release since it has a 5.x stable release now.
	- TOC bump for 5.1.x
	- Backwards compatability for 5.0.x in Chi module.
	- Remove Aspect of the Fox with WoW 5.1 from the Aura Filters.
Benjamin Staneck:
	- SPELL_POWER_CHI is the new SPELL_POWER_LIGHT_FORCE, no backwards compat, have fun Shefki :D
Shefki:
	- Give the Rage of Anger a red power bar.
	Specifically map POWER_TYPE_RED_POWER to RAGE since they both translate
	to Rage.
	- Change the default to not hide Blizzard's AltPowerBar.
	If you want it hidden you'll have to toggle it back hidden by doing:
	/pb, Modules, Hide Blizzard, check Alternate power.
