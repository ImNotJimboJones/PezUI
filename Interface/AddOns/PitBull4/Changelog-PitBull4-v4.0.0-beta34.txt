Tagging as v4.0.0-beta34


--------------------

Shefki:
	- Fix background on the BurningEmbers module when set to vertical.
	- Fix the background on the HolyPower module when set to vertical.
	- Fix two typos.  One leaked a global variable.  Both prevented LuaTexts from knowing if a spell was interruptible or not.
	- Fix a leak of the global variable _ in Portrait module, which also breaks the Glyph UI due to a Blizzard bug.
	Only occured when class was the portrait type or fallback type.
	- Fix a typo that leaked a global variable and that actually broke the OnUpdate throttling for the Aura module.
	- Fix leak of player_in_group variable into global namespace.
	Another case of me testing and forgetting to put back to local after
	modifying for 5.0.
	- Fix master_looter_guid leaking into the global namespace.
	I removed the local while testing this and I forgot to put it back when
	I finished updating the module for 5.0.
	- Add Rapid Teleportation to Mage self buffs.
