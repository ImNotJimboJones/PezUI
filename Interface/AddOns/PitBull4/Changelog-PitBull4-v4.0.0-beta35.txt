Tagging as v4.0.0-beta35


--------------------

Shefki:
	- Remove some config options that don't do anything in the SoulShard module.
	- Fix issue that would break ShadowOrb module after changing profiles.
	Same issue as HolyPower module had.
	- Fix problem with Chi module not updating after a profile change.
	Same problem as HolyPower module.
	- Fix problem with HolyPower module no long updating correctly after changing profiles.
	In particular it would update before the profile had been completely loaded and then the color would be stuck on black.
	- Show Totem module for DK's without a spec picked.
	- Improve the graphics for the Monk Chi module.
	- Arcane Charge shows up as a debuff, move under the self debuffs filter.
	- Refresh frame layouts after the group headers are done on profile changes.  Should prevent some odd edge cases with changing profiles with different configs on the same group header.
	- Fix some places where we could end up comparing a number with nil.
