Tagging v4.0.0-beta36


--------------------

Shefki:
	- Change the default color for the AltPowerBar to match what Blizzard uses in their raid frames.
	- Update the logic for the AltPowerBar to avoid showing it when the game has flagged not to.
	- Fix an error in the AlterPowerBar module that would make it show incorrect info for alternate powers where the minimum wasn't zero.
	- Fix the typo in the AltPowerBar that someone I reverted again. Oops.
	- Implement aura filters fully for Monk.
	- Refix party and raid config mode after adding hiding of frames for pet battles.
	When I yanked the old ForceShow code I forgot to leave it in place for
	the Group frames.
	- Handling hiding the frames during pet battles.
	This also lays the ground work for user configured macro conditionals
	for hiding/showing the frames.
	- Prevent an error when the fader module starts trying to update before the layoutdb is loaded for the frame.
